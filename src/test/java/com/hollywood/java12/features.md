# Java 12

* Shenandoah - new low pause time GC for heaps of any size (experimental) NB - seems to be difficult to find it too!
* (Preview) New switch expression that returns a value, also new -> shorthand
* JVM Constants API for bytecode manipulation
* Changes to G1 garbage collectors for mixed collection (mandatory/opt) and early return of unused committed memory

Notes:

* Switch expression in 13 changed break "val" to yield, and it became a proper feature in 14
